Todo
- when implementing database, need to add service calls in the models. 
- checks for quests are to be done on the frontend
- add a unique key to the quests and items
- where to keep list of point type -> store items
- completing quests adds points

Interesting thoughts on what to implement?
- enums for the type of quest, but is enums even in javascript? seems to be in typescript
- completed quests contain all the quests? 
    - lets keep them... organize by year/month/day etc..
    - learn pagination! imagine if this helps with what Chon was doing lol, actually maybe, since I will be using sqlite too..
- my model seems to be a mix of a controller and a model...
    - model would just be the data itself, so the variables
    - controllers are the functions doing the changes...
- maybe i should seprate the model and controller, make the controller a js object
- quests should have rewards
    - .... i should make these into classes
    - rewards can be points or just actual stuff
    - ex. daily quest rewards gives me game time at night that i can redeem
    - extra stuff like... coding/reading gives me points to spend
- need to have a user class
